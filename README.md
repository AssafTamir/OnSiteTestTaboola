# OnSiteTestTaboola

Exercise

The file “all” on the desktop contains an Apache log​file.
The goal is to process this file and output some analytics about the users of the web server.
Specifically, please print the following properties:
1. The list of countries of the site’s visitors, along with the % of users from each country.
2. The operating system distribution.
3. The browser distribution.
First, think of a design for the task and call your tester afterwards.
Requirements:
● At least one of the properties (countries, os, browser) should fully work.
● The code must be object oriented, for example: if we want to extract another
property from the log, it should be added easily.
● Object oriented is more important than performance.
● Precision should be 2 digits after decimal point.
● The printed list should be sorted in a descending order.
Tips:
● You can (and should) use google and 3rd party jars.
● If you get stuck ­ don’t be shy and ask one of the testers.
